title=Handmade maps: An Map Overhaul [B42]
description=[h3]Are you bothered by the fact that your character can just simply grab a map out of thin air and find his way like it's a full fledged GPS system? SPEAK NO MORE! This mod overhauls PZ map system to be a bit more realistic.[/h3]

description=[h1]HOW IT WORKS[/h1]
description=
description=[h3]1. Get some paper[/h3]
description=- Find some sheets of paper laying around or simply tear them off notebooks, notepads and journals
description=
description=[h3]2. Sketch your surroundings[/h3]
description=- With a piece of paper and a pencil, go outside to draw a map of your surroundings
description=- The higher you are, the more you can see (Bigger map area), Make use of rooftops and balconies!
description=- Obs: Trying to make a map sketch inside a building with no outside view will result in an empty map. Go next to a window to see the area around you
description=
description=[h3]3. Create your world map[/h3]
description=- Use 4 sheets of paper and a adhesive tape to create an handmade Knox Country map (It will start empty)
description=- Now it's time to build your world map! Get some sketches and town maps, and with some colored pencils, you can transfer them all to the world map using the new recipe "Add Region to Map"
description=- Obs: Every world map (Handmade map) have it's own data (Known regions, annotations), so if you lose your map, building another one will not recover all your knowledge
description=
description=[h3]EXTRA. Flyers[/h3]
description=- Now, reading flyers won't reveal their area on the world map. Instead, a point of interest will be added in their place (Question mark)

description=[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
description=
description=Q: "Why fliers don't reveal the map anymore?"
description=A: "Because fliers aren't a map, most of them are just adresses to some place"

description=COMPATIBILITY:
description=
description=This mod may not be compatible with any mod that changes the functionality of the world map and annotations. Cosmetic mods should work normally.

description=I made this mod for personal use, as i always thought that the new map system was too easy and unrealistic for a game like PZ. Anyway, feel free to post bugs and suggestions on the comments below.
