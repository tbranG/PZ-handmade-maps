title=Handmade maps: Interactive Mapping [B42]
description=[h3]Are you bothered by the fact that your character can just simply grab a map out of thin air and find his way like it's a full fledged GPS system? SPEAK NO MORE! This mod completely overhauls PZ's map system.[/h3]

description=[h2]Major changes:[/h2]
description=1. Basicaly, with this mod the world map becomes an physical item (take care of your map, everything it's stored in it, if you lose it, you lose your map knowledge). The world map will also work as a collection of all your maps, both found and crafted (NEW). You can add regions to your world map via the new mapping feature
description=2. There's a mapping feature, where you can create your own custom maps
description=3. In the world map, you can no longer see where your character are in real time.
description=4.  The fog of war (undiscovered areas) will no longer be revealed by exploration (walking by), only by the mapping feature.
description=5. Now, reading a flier will not reveal it's map area in the world map. Instead, a point of interest will be created (Question mark).

description=[h1]HOW IT WORKS (Step-by-step)[/h1]
description=
description=[h3]1. Get some paper[/h3]
description=- Find some sheets of paper laying around or simply tear them off notebooks, notepads and journals
description=
description=[h3]2. Sketch your surroundings[/h3]
description=- With a piece of paper and a pencil, you can now draw a sketch of your surroundings (It's available via right click)
description=- The higher you are, the more you can see (Bigger map area), Make use of rooftops and balconies!
description=- Obs: Trying to make a map sketch inside a building with no outside view will result in an empty map. Go next to a window to see the area around you.

description=[h3]3. Create your world map[/h3]
description=- Use 6 sheets of paper and adhesive tape/stapler/clips to create a handmade Knox Country map (It will start empty)
description=- Now it's time to build your world map! Get some sketches or town maps, and with some colored pencils, you can transfer them all to the world map. Or if you prefer, go explore the world, and before sleeping, you can add all the places you visited that day.

description=[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
description=
description=Q: "Why fliers don't reveal the map anymore?"
description=A: "Because fliers aren't a map, most of them are just addresses to some place"
description=
description=COMPATIBILITY:
description=
description=Due to major changes in the world map code, mods that changes the functionality of the world map and annotations will not work. And sadly, after many tests, nor even cosmetic mods are compatible.

description=I made this mod for personal use, as i always thought that the new map system was too easy and unrealistic for a game like PZ. Anyway, feel free to post bugs and suggestions on the comments below.
