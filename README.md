# PZ-handmade-maps

Handmade maps is a PZ's mod that completely overhauls it's map system.

Major changes:

1. Basicaly, with this mod the world map becomes an physical item (take care of your map, everything it's stored in it, if you lose it, you lose your map knowledge). The world map will also work as a collection of all your maps, both found and crafted (NEW). You can add regions to your world map via the new mapping feature
2. There's a mapping feature, where you can create your own custom maps
3. In the world map, you can no longer see where your character are in real time.
4. The fog of war (undiscovered areas) will no longer be revealed by exploration (walking by), only by the mapping feature.
5. Now, reading a flier will not reveal it's map area in the world map. Instead, a point of interest will be created (Question mark).
